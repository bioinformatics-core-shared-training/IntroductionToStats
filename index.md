### Introduction to Statistical Analysis.

This course provides a refresher on the foundations of statistical analysis. Practicals are conducted using the 'Shiny' package; which provides an accessible interface to the R statistical language.

Note that this is not a course for learning about the R statistical language itself. If you wish to learn more about R, please see other courses at the University of Cambridge

### Aims

During this course you will learn about:

- Different types of data, distributions and structure within data
- Summary statistics for continuous and discrete data
- Formulating a null hypothesis
- Assumptions of one-sample and two-sample t-tests
- Interpreting the result of a statistical test
- Statistical tests of categorical variables (Chi-squared and Fisher's exact tests)
- Non-parametric versions of one- and two-sample tests (Wilcoxon tests)

We will not cover ANOVA or linear regression here but these are the topics of a [more advanced course](https://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/linear-models-r)

### Learning Objectives

After this course you should be able to:-

- State the assumptions required for a one-sample and two-sample t-test and be able to interpret the results of such a test
- Know when to apply a paired or independent two-sample t-test
- To perform simple statistical calculations using the online app
- Understand the limitations of the tests taught within the course
- Know when more complex statistical methods are required
