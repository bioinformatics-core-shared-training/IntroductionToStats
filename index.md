### Introduction to Statistical Analysis.

This course provides a refresher on the foundations of statistical analysis.

The practical sessions use web applications that were developed specifically for
this course with the [R](https://cran.r-project.org) statistical programming
language and the [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery) framework. Although
the trainers use R as their statistical computing environment of choice, the
focus of the course is on understanding basic statistical concepts rather than
learning a particular statistical package.

Note that this is not a course for learning about the R statistical language.
If you wish to learn more about R, please take a look at some of the
[other courses](https://bioinfotraining.bio.cam.ac.uk) available at the
University of Cambridge.

### Trainers

- Dominique-Laurent Couturier
- Matthew Eldridge

### Aims

During this course you will learn about:

- Different types of data, distributions and structure within data
- Summary statistics for continuous and discrete data
- Formulating a null hypothesis
- Assumptions of one-sample and two-sample t-tests
- Interpreting the result of a statistical test
- Non-parametric versions of one- and two-sample tests (Wilcoxon tests)

We will not cover ANOVA or linear regression here but these are the topics of a
[more advanced course](https://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/linear-models-r).

### Learning Objectives

After this course you should be able to:-

- State the assumptions required for a one-sample and two-sample t-test and be able to interpret the results of such a test
- Know when to apply a paired or independent two-sample t-test
- To perform simple statistical calculations using the online app
- Understand the limitations of the tests taught within the course
- Know when more complex statistical methods are required
